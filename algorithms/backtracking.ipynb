The iterator i will then range from start to end, allowing us to swap to current section of the array for all sub permutations, with everything before start being fixed (from previous swaps higher in the tree).\n",
    " - i = 0, start is placed at 0 for the first level, and i varies from [start, ...]. Then for dfs, we pass down start+1, so that the new i will manage swapping between start + 1 to end.\n",
    " - This will capture all permutations correctly. If you think about it, it's like swapping one combination at a time as we go down to tree - keeping everything before it fixed (we're exploring all combinations off of the current swap we made) the accumulated combinations leading to one unique permutation because the order matters. \n",
    " - Once we reach a leaf, we'll backtrack by one swap (on the current recursive level by just swapping start and i again so we have the original configuration before the most recent DFS)."
