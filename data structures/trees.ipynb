    " - We'll use a queue to go through each level of the tree as well as keep track of the current level (the height) with it being 1-indexed.\n",
    " - Once we've encountered the first leaf node in the queue, we break and return the level we're on so far, the rest of the tree doesn't need to be explored.\n",
    " - This does not require recursion: just needs a while loop (while queue is not empty) and the inner being a for loop to completely explore the current level."
