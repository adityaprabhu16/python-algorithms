    "Delete a Node from a Binary Search Tree\n",

    " - Traversal: Traverse BST from root to find key.\n",
    " - Inorder Traversal to Repair Subtree: Do INORDER traversal to find the inorder successor or predecesser and update current node's value.\n",
    "    - Recall: we want to make sure BST is valid (at current node, want to ensure all left children are smaller and all right children are greater).\n",
    "    - To do this, we can either find next largest node (smallest one in the right subtree) - inorder successor, or previous smallest node (largest one in the left subtree) - in order predecessor.\n",
    " - This ensures we don't have to completely overhaul the whole tree, by making the observation that the node we need at the root of the subtree must be the next adjacent node if this was a sorted array.\n",
    " - We can use inorder traversal to find this next node the easiest by getting the inorder successor, since it's just one DFS path in the right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Time Complexity: O(logN) worst case to find the key, which will be the biggest time sink. In order traversal may also need to scale the height of the tree.\n",
    " - Edit: solution below isn't quite right, but fix this in a couple weeks to practice it. Try implementing via both ways so you truly understand the traversal of a BST, even if you need to sketch it out.\n",
